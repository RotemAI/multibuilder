# Changelog (tmux-dashboard scratch / docs)

This repo is primarily the tmux-dashboard FastAPI app. Recent additions
also include the bioinformatics review documentation packets for
23andclaude.com (the genomics service that lives in the sibling
`23andClaude` repository).

## 2026-08-23 / MultiBuilder live agent streams

- Added a live per-agent work panel to the project Overview with direct links to every complete run stream.
- Agent streams now repaint on event-only updates, follow the latest output, preserve scroll position when inspecting history, and expose command output, exit codes, messages, tools, and state changes.
- Complete run histories load with cursor pagination. Provider output deltas and repeated heartbeats are grouped without dropping content.
- Added server-side run filtering for efficient history retrieval after the next safe service restart. The compatible frontend pagination is already live without interrupting active agents.
- Verified desktop and 375 px mobile layouts, zero browser console errors, and the full MultiBuilder test suite.

## 2026-05-14 / 2026-05-15 — `pipelinesdocsv2/` + `pipelinesdocs/`

Two markdown documentation packets served under nginx at
<https://23andclaude.com/pipelinesdocs/> and
<https://23andclaude.com/pipelinesdocsv2/>.

### `pipelinesdocs/` (v1 — kept for reference)

Original ten-chapter packet covering the 23andclaude PGS pipeline
end-to-end. Predates the safety-gate / advisor-driven rebuild.

### `pipelinesdocsv2/` (v2 — current)

Sixteen-chapter packet plus a `modules/` subdirectory cataloguing
adjacent services. Index:

Chapters 14 + 15 captured two intensive advisor cycles + the Wave 0
safety gate + Wave 1 foundations + Items 1–5 from the second
advisor's "second-opinion" review (continuous PC-regression
normalization, `--chr 1-22,X,Y,XY` filter, pgsc_calc sanity-check
harness, HGDP+1kGP unified panel). All implementation lives in the
sibling `23andClaude` repository — see its `CHANGELOG.md` for the
code-level history.

Headline live evidence captured during the session:

- ADHD PGS002746 EAS replay → previously rendered `null` percentile
  with an LLM-paraphrased catastrophizing message; now renders a
  deterministic `REF_STATS_SCHEMA_INVALID` reason + templated prose
  that names it as a *"pipeline data issue, not a biological finding."*
- pgsc_calc cross-validation on HG002 + PGS000004 → **78.1**
  percentile (PC-normalized); our pre-Item-4 discrete-bucket pipeline
  gave **99.5** (clamped from z=3.27). A 21 pp gap that the new
  PC-regression module closes.
- HGDP+1kGP panel staged on host (`/data/pgsc_refs/pgsc_HGDP+1kGP_v1/`,
  3,942 samples) — first time the platform has 158 Middle Eastern
  reference samples available.
